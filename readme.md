# NSSVM Python Implementation

This repository contains the Python implementation of the Nonlinear Sparse Support Vector Machine (NSSVM), which is designed for large and sparse datasets. This implementation aims to efficiently optimize a hyperplane to maximally separate two classes, emphasizing sparsity in the solution.

## Features

- Implements the NSSVM algorithm for efficient data classification.
- Handles both dense and sparse data formats seamlessly.
- Includes Jupyter notebooks for easy demonstration and comparison with regular SVMs.

## Quick Start

You can quickly start experimenting with the NSSVM algorithm by accessing Google Colab notebooks:

- [Regular SVM's for Comparison](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gUzm_euQRMJ7glNz212Ykw8d2UAgu7AG?usp=sharing) <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>

## Installation

To get started with the local setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavan98765/NSSVM_python.git
cd NSSVM_python
```
